# Trident 🔱™ ©  
A sovereign, modular CLI platform for diagnostics, identity, repair, and deterministic hardening.  
Built for clarity, reproducibility, and operational excellence.  
Apache 2.0 Licensed.

---

## 🔱 Overview

**Trident** is a sovereign, Apache‑licensed command‑line platform designed to bring structure, diagnostics, identity, repair, and hardening into a unified, deterministic toolchain.

What began as a local systems‑repair utility has evolved into a modular, extensible CLI ecosystem capable of:

- Hardening project structures  
- Generating canonical files  
- Producing diffs and backups  
- Enforcing deterministic layouts  
- Running safely inside Docker  
- Supporting plugins and future modules  

Trident is built for developers, operators, and teams who value **clarity, reproducibility, and operational trust**.

---

## 🔱 Features

### **Deterministic Hardening Engine**
- Generates canonical `main.py`, metrics modules, auth routes, and monitoring files  
- Writes files with audit banners  
- Shows diffs before writing  
- Creates `.bak` backups automatically  
- Supports full rollback  

### **Safe by Design**
- Never writes inside `site-packages`  
- Never overwrites backups  
- Logs all operations  
- Dry‑run mode for safe previews  

### **Docker‑Ready**
Run the updater in a clean, isolated environment:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "/path/to/project":/target \
  trident-updater \
  --target /target --dry-run
