## 🔱 Guiding Principles

- **Determinism** — Every change must be reproducible and predictable.  
- **Safety** — No destructive operations without backups or rollback paths.  
- **Clarity** — Code should be readable, documented, and explicit.  
- **Separation of concerns** — Logic, templates, and configuration must remain cleanly separated.  
- **Auditability** — All generated files must include banners and logs.  
- **Respect for the ecosystem** — The updater must never modify site‑packages or global environments.
